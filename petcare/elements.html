							<h2>PETS DAYCARE</h2>
							<p>Daycare, often refers to a short-term daytime care for pets. It fills a niche between multi-day kennel boarding and pet sitting, where the sitter comes to the pet's home.It shares many similarities with a regular daycare for children, with the exception being that a pets daycare is for canines.The two share the same philosophy. Parents, or in the case of the dog daycare, owners, have a busy schedule and the often prolonged hours at work drastically reduce the time that could be spent with their children or pets </p>

							<h4>DOG &amp; CAT</h4>
							<p><span class="image left"><img src="images/d19.jpeg" alt="" /></span>Pet care is responsible for cats and dogs care while their clients are on vacation or traveling for business. They must be able to perform the following tasks:

                 Provide food and water.
					Brush fur and teeth and carry out other types of grooming.
Walk dogs.
Clean litter boxes.
Give medications, if applicable.
Pet care are also responsible for notifying owners and taking pets to the vet if they should become sick or suffer an injury while under their supervision. It is important that pet care require owners to fill out a detailed contact sheet with their contact information, their vet’s contact information, and relevant information about the pet .</p>
							<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/d30.jpeg" alt="" /></span>Pet sitters must enjoy spending time with animals and have a gentle — yet assertive when necessary — way with them.
Reliable: Their clients count on them to take care of their beloved pets when they can't, so pet sitters have to be reliable and provide their services for as long as they have committed to.
Trustworthy: Pet sitters have free run of a home while the owner is away. They must prove themselves worthy of the trust the owners invest in them.Dog and cat training is a career that combines knowledge of animal behavior with practical teaching skills. Patience, consistency, and excellent communication skills (both verbal and nonverbal) help a trainer to effectively teach their canine and human clients.Several key skills all dog industry professionals should possess include the ability to handle and train dogs, the ability to interact with the animal to recognize behavioral signals and needs, and have knowledge of the animal's grooming and healthcare needs.</p>
